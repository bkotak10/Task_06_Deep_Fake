# Research Task 06 — AI-Generated Deep Fake Interview

**Author:** Bhaarat Kotak  
**Dataset:** Syracuse Men’s Soccer 2024 (from Task 05)

---

## Project Overview

In this task, I experimented with AI video generation tools to simulate an ESPN-style coach interview.  
The idea was to take the Syracuse Men’s Soccer 2024 stats from my Task 05 analysis and turn them into a short, realistic-looking interview video.

The interview was designed to highlight:
- Season recap based on stats
- Defensive strategy improvements
- Key player contributions
- A motivational closing message

While the plan was to generate three distinct clips (stadium, press conference, and locker room), the tool I used had limitations and only produced one usable outdoor clip. Still, it provided valuable insights into what these AI systems can and can’t do.

## Goal of the Task

- Turn my Task 05 analysis into a deep fake–style interview.  
- Make it feel like a real ESPN broadcast, with backgrounds, camera angles, and crowd noise.  
- Explore how far current AI video generation can go — and where it falls short.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Understanding Requirements
I reviewed the instructions and mapped my Task 05 findings into an interview-style script.

### Step 2 — Exploring Tools
I tried different platforms:
- **D-ID & HeyGen** → Explored, but watermarks and free-plan limits were a problem.  
- **Synthesia** → Looked good, but not available under my student plan.  
- **Gemini Veo 3 Fast** → Chosen for its quality, though it ended up producing only one outdoor-style clip.

**Limitations I faced:**
- 3-hour cooldown between attempts.  
- Only ~7 seconds per clip.  
- Couldn’t upload datasets directly — had to manually integrate my analysis.  
- Backgrounds didn’t change — the tool kept giving me outdoor footage only.

### Step 3 — Building the Script & Prompts
I wrote a script using my Task 05 stats:
- Syracuse scored and conceded almost the same number of goals.  
- Shot conversion rate was lower than our opponents.  
- Stronger defense could boost win rate by ~30%.  
- Key players: **Gabe Threadgold** (midfield) and **Michael Acquah** (goalkeeper).

### Step 4 — Generating the Clips
I aimed for three clips (Recap, Strategy & Players, Closing).  
The tool only generated one outdoor stadium clip with bits of two prompts.

### Step 5 — Editing Attempt
I used **CapCut** to merge and polish, but since I only had one clip, the final output was limited.

## Tools Used

| Tool/Platform       | Purpose                  | Outcome                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Gemini Veo 3 Fast   | AI video generation      | Only one outdoor video generated |
| Coach Image         | Avatar + lip-sync        | Added realism                    |
| CapCut              | Editing + merging        | Limited, due to single clip      |
| D-ID / HeyGen       | Alternative tools        | Explored only                    |

## Prompts Used

I designed three short prompts for:  
1. Season recap (stadium)  
2. Defensive strategy & key players (press conference)  
3. Motivational closing (locker room)  

But the AI tool only managed to generate the outdoor version.

## Challenges & Learnings

**Challenges**
- No background variety — all outdoor setting.  
- Short runtime per clip.  
- Manual dataset integration.  
- Needed multiple refinements, but results stayed limited.

**Learnings**
- Stats-based prompts help make AI interviews sound more authentic.  
- Using a real coach image improves lip-sync and realism.  
- Iteration is key, but tools have hard limits.  
- CapCut works well for editing, but only if you have multiple clips to combine.

## Final Output

- Duration: ~7 seconds  
- Style: ESPN-style Syracuse Men’s Soccer interview  
- Content: Combined insights from two prompts  
- Quality: Limited — only one background, no variations

## Takeaway

This project showed me both the potential and the current limits of AI video generation.  
With strong prompts and real stats, you can get surprisingly realistic clips. But at the same time, today’s free-access tools are restrictive. Future work would involve testing more advanced platforms to create multi-scene, professional-quality interview videos.
